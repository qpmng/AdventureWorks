# AdventureWorks Database Analysis
## Introduction

This analysis aims to utilize the online and reseller sales data to determine which products or product categories keep customers returning to AdventureWorks. The company also wants to identify similar patterns or trends in the sales data to devise effective business strategies.<br/>
